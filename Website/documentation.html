<p>Welcome to the Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide wiki!</p>
<h1 id="-disclaimer-faq-please-read-before-proceeding-">!! Disclaimer &amp; FAQ !! - PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING!</h1>
<h2 id="disclaimer-please-read"><strong>Disclaimer: PLEASE READ</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This guide is a community provided reference material that you can choose to follow at your own risk - and the risk of your hardware.</li>
<li>I / We are not responsible for any damage that this may or may not cause. Typically in this guide, warning is given on specific tasks that have risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-windows-11-why-not-windows-10-"><em>Why Windows 11? Why Not Windows 10 ?</em></h2>
<p>You can still follow 99%(guestimation) of this guide with Windows 10. If you plan to play FIFA 23 or Valorant, use Windows 10, as they do not work on Windows 11.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons though why Windows 11 was chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 11 is the SteamDeck Windows Community&#39;s more popular choice from testing experience</li>
<li>Typically we have found that Windows 11 provides better touch accuracy</li>
<li>Touch keyboard that moves apps out of the way instead of overlaying them</li>
<li>Better support/compatibility for Bluetooth</li>
<li>Future-proofing -- Microsoft has in the past locked gaming features behind newer Operating Systems(like making Direct X 12 only work on Windows 10)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-use-a-microsd-for-windows-operating-system-"><em>Should I use a microSD for Windows Operating System?</em></h2>
<p>I absolutely <strong>cannot</strong> recommend that a microSD be used for Windows Operating System (You can of course, use a microSD for storage for games)</p>
<p>Some have argued about this with me-- and that&#39;s fine, you don&#39;t need to follow this guide then, or pick and choose what you want to follow. It is after all, <em>your SteamDeck</em>. I won&#39;t however assist in troubleshooting your performance problems or Operating System issues if you choose to use a microSD-- you are on your own.</p>
<p>For the long answer as to <em>why</em>, see the bottom article of bottom of this page(or right here): <a href="https://github.com/baldsealion/Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide/wiki#why-i-believe-microsd-is-a-bad-idea">Why I Believe microSD is a Bad Idea</a></p>
<h2 id="what-about-an-external-solid-state-drive-"><em>What about an External Solid State Drive ?</em></h2>
<p>Yes, that can work ok, as long as you mean an actualy Solid State Drive with m2 slot and not a USB Flash Drive(this will perform same or worse than microSD)</p>
<h2 id="are-there-any-issues-with-external-solid-state-drives-"><em>Are there any issues with External Solid State Drives?</em></h2>
<p>Yes. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If your External SSD is connected to a hub/dock and connected to the charger, when you disconnect the charger, it is likely that Windows will freeze. Possible work-arounds would be sleeping the device first before disconnecting the charger cable, though this has limited success. Possibly more successful would be to hibernate the device first instead of sleep.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must use Windows To Go instead of the main Windows Home/Pro installation</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are connected through a dock made for the Steam Deck, your bandwidth for throughout may be limited to 5GBps. This is a very YMMV situation, but something to be aware of and will vary based on the dock&#39;s technical specifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-there-any-recommended-external-solid-state-drives-"><em>Are there any recommended External Solid State Drives ?</em></h2>
<p>Really, the Steam Deck should be compatible with any external solid state drives. However if you&#39;re looking for a specific model, a community member had 4 different external drives and confirmed these 3 are compatible(the 4th was not, model was WD SN750– this is likely an enclosure compatibility issue more than a drive issue):</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung T7 external</li>
<li>WD SN350</li>
<li>Team group Vulcan ZForce</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-is-the-gaming-performance-in-windows-versus-steamos-"><em>How is the gaming performance in Windows versus SteamOS ?</em></h2>
<p>This will vary based on a lot of factors(what other apps you have included in Windows outside of this guide, what build of Windows you are using, etc) but typically in community testing, benchmarks perform similar, if not better, than their SteamOS counterparts. Some games can run faster in SteamOS thanks to pre-cached shaders, but you can also implement this using something like <a href="https://github.com/baldsealion/Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide/wiki/1.7-Quality-of-Life-Improvements#dxvk-vulkan-rendering-on-windows">DXVK in Windows</a> </p>
<h2 id="how-is-battery-life-in-windows-versus-steamos-"><em>How is Battery Life in Windows versus SteamOS ?</em></h2>
<p>Again this will vary based on your system, but if you follow this guide, very comparable! I don&#39;t have any fancy benchmarks to show you here, just personal &amp; community testing experience.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-fan-control-for-windows-"><em>Is there fan control for Windows ?</em></h2>
<p>Yes! This is covered in Section 1.6 of this guide. However, it is in an experimental phase so use at your own risk(but in testing, there haven&#39;t been any issues). This is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ayufan-research/steam-deck-tools">Ayufan&#39;s SteamDeck Tools</a></p>
<h2 id="is-there-anything-that-steamos-can-do-that-windows-cannot-"><em>Is there anything that SteamOS can do that Windows cannot ?</em></h2>
<p>Yes. 
<!---* Windows GPU drivers at this time do not have hardware codecs, which means game streaming performance is not as good as SteamOS when using things like SteamLink, Moonlight, Parsec, etc to a host machine.---></p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the SteamDeck in Windows as a remote streaming host(but you can use it as a streaming client). Windows cannot modify GPU clocks currently. You can however, modify Refresh Rate, TDP, Framerate &amp; disable SMT-- more about that later in the guide.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-installing-windows-modify-my-bios-or-mess-up-my-hardware-"><em>Will installing Windows modify my BIOS, or mess up my hardware ?</em></h2>
<p>No, you can always revert back, as long as you have a spare USB flash drive and another computer, you can always reinstall SteamOS from scratch using the Recovery Image provided by Valve:</p>
<p><a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3">Steam Deck Recovery</a></p>
<h2 id="is-official-dual-boot-available-"><em>Is official dual boot available ?</em></h2>
<p>No, you can check here to see if this guide is outdated and incorrect and it is in fact available:</p>
<p><a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-eccd-d643-baa8">Valves Windows Resources</a></p>
<h2 id="can-you-dual-boot-"><em>Can you Dual Boot ?</em></h2>
<p>Yes, if your hard drive is 256GB or 512GB(or greater), please proceed to follow the guide</p>
<h2 id="if-i-dual-boot-what-happens-to-steamos-"><em>If I Dual Boot, what happens to SteamOS?</em></h2>
<p>As long as the Dual Boot process is successfully performed, SteamOS will remain intact. There have been some instances where SteamOS could no longer boot after Windows was installed, but you can use the Image Recovery tool and perform a re-install(not re-image) to fix</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-access-steamos-after-windows-is-installed-"><em>How do I access SteamOS after Windows is installed?</em></h2>
<p>Windows will add itself to the Bootloader and make itself the primary boot option. This means that when the device is powered on or rebooted, it will automatically load into Windows. To get into SteamOS, with the device powered off, hold <code>Volume - &amp; Power</code>, this will access the boot menu, you can use the D-Pad to select SteamOS and A to launch it </p>
<h2 id="can-i-still-dual-boot-if-i-have-the-64gb-version-of-the-steamdeck-"><em>Can I still Dual Boot if I have the 64GB version of the SteamDeck ?</em></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, SteamOS needs a minimum of 32GB, it&#39;s nearly impossible to fit both on the 64GB model. You could clone SteamOS to a micro SD, then wipe Windows. This is a lengthy procedure, there is a video about this here - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvWciCo4xk&amp;t">SteamOS on a Micro SD Card</a></p>
<h2 id="how-else-can-i-install-windows-if-i-only-have-64gb-"><em>How else can I install Windows if I only have 64GB ?</em></h2>
<p>Be warned that if you do this, you will not be able to perform any SteamOS firmware updates, this includes the SteamOS dock(there have been reports of people that have successfully &quot;flashed&quot; the firmware without SteamOS, but it is a risky process and this guide will not be covering that). You will need to erase the SteamDeck partition completely before proceeding with Windows install. This guide will not cover that process, but if you use G-Parted or another similar Partition Tool, then you can erase the SteamOS partition and proceed to install Windows with a USB Flash Drive.</p>
<h1 id="why-i-believe-microsd-is-a-bad-idea">Why I Believe microSD is a Bad Idea</h1>
<p><strong>*If you read all of the below information and still want to proceed with a microSD install, I cannot assist you in doing so, or really assist in support</strong>(ex. I cannot help troubleshoot your random BSODs)</p>
<p>microSD on Windows I think can be summed up in 3 major issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Life expectancy will be drastically shortened for a micro SD with <em>regular use</em> as Windows Operating System.</strong> Why? The cells get corrupted after too much writing. Now you would wonder -- but this is just Flash Memory, isn&#39;t that what a Solid State Drive is? Yes-- but the behavior in which they write to their individual cells is different. For a Solid State Drive, it is designed so that each cell is written to evenly, so everyone participates, resulting in a long healthy life. With a microSD, it is designed so that it writes to any free available space it sees first, making it much more common to overwrite the same cells over and over. With Windows having so many disk writes happening, your card can be rendered useless over a short period of time. The claimed “10,000” writes, are testing the entire micro SD card. Most likely, you will fill up the microSD with games and have very little free space. Windows will use that remaining free space over and over for its writes, so the claims of 10,000 writes are not technically valid here.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Windows is inherently terrible at managing your microSD hardware.</strong> You will get occasional, unwanted ejects. If your operating system is on it, it&#39;s time for a complete system crash!(ex. BSOD, unexpected reboot, etc). Some drivers work better than others, but this is definitely a Windows issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your bottleneck will always be your microSD.</strong> Solid State Drives have a large cache to store data before it is permanently written, microSDs have a much smaller cache. This is part of the reason their performance is worse. Additionally, they are inherently terrible at random read/write processes, which Windows uses frequently. You might be able to &quot;get by&quot; and have a somewhat stable experience(at best), but just know you will be typically be limiting your SteamDeck gaming performance if you are playing any recent/demanding games.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some technical performance benchmarks using CrystalDiskMark from the SteamDeck Windows community for you to digest(<strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all benchmarks were performed with the same specifications):</p>

<h1 id="windows-11-installation-info-common-questions">Windows 11 Installation Info &amp; Common Questions</h1>
<p>Currently, the current recommended version of Windows 11 is 22H2</p>
<p>The recommended method to install Windows is to either install it onto the internal Solid State Drive(from a USB flash drive, or micro SD card), or connect an external Solid State Drive. </p>
<p>Using a microSD or USB Flash Drive is <strong>NOT recommended</strong> for running Windows. You can see more about that on the <a href="https://github.com/baldsealion/Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide/wiki#why-microsd-is-a-bad-idea">Home Page</a></p>
<h2 id="what-exact-version-of-windows-should-i-get-"><em>What Exact Version of Windows Should I Get?</em></h2>
<p>Typically the recommendation will be stock Windows 11 which can be obtained from Microsoft <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11?9d47a9e1-e53b-49a1-92ca-a647d62dc410=True">Here</a></strong></p>
<!---* **NOTE:** If wanting a "seamless"(eliminating "Welcome" screen) Windows logon with Playnite, you will need either Windows Enterprise or Windows Education edition. Home or Pro editions will not work for this(this is covered in the guide section **[1.7 Playnite Setup](https://github.com/baldsealion/Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide/wiki/1.7-Playnite-Setup-(WIP)#custom-welcome-logo-optional--requires-windows-enterprise-or-education-edition))**--->
<h2 id="what-about-a-debloat-script-or-custom-windows-installation-"><em>What about a debloat script, or custom Windows installation?</em></h2>
<p>I can&#39;t recommend a custom Windows version because of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Windows builds that you can download violate Microsoft&#39;s re-distribution terms </li>
<li>They often leave out important functionality that you may need later, or can cause un-expected issues with game compatibility, making it difficult to troubleshoot the exact issue</li>
</ul>
<p>As an optional suggestion, you can go through this tutorial here when Windows is finished installing to de-bloat your system to your liking(The video is skipped to 9 minute marker because he just rants about Microsoft up to then) <a href="https://youtu.be/8ReoMuCUdKE?t=543">Debloat Windows 11 The Easy Way</a></p>
<h1 id="youtube-tutorial-for-dual-boot-read-completely-">YouTube Tutorial for Dual Boot(READ COMPLETELY)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> you will need at least 1 USB flash drive, or micro SD card(the tutorial uses 2 Flash Drives, one for G-Parted and one for Windows, but you could use 1 flash drive/micro SD and complete the G-Parted portion of the tutorial, then flash Windows after) -- and should use a mouse and keyboard connect to the SteamDeck, or you&#39;re going to have a bad time adjusting the size of the partition(you can use the slider but it&#39;s less accurate):</li>

<p>This is necessary for some games to even run in Windows(ex. Guardians of the Galaxy), but in testing has also decreased stutter and increased overall in-game performance. </p>
<p>Changing this assigns the minimum amount of RAM allocated for the GPU. The maximum is 4GB which is recommended.</p>
<p>This can always be changed back. In rare circumstances, this can have a negative impact for performance on games(for games that specifically demand more RAM than VRAM). In this instance you can change it back to the default value of 1G</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to be prompted for your Windows password when powering on, or waking from sleep, follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download, open and run <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autologon">Autologon by Sysinternals/Microsoft</a> </li>
<li>Make sure the correct account is set and put in your password, then click <strong>Enable</strong> (application doesn&#39;t need to run again unless your password changes)</li>
<li>To disable from asking for password when waking from sleep, run Command Prompt as Administrator and enter the following command:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>PowerCfg /SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_NONE CONSOLELOCK 0</code></p>
<p><code>PowerCfg /SETDCVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_NONE CONSOLELOCK 0</code></p>
<p>Reboot to apply</p>
<h1 id="adjust-scaling">Adjust Scaling</h1>
<p>In Windows, the default Scale is set to 125% - this will result in some windows not fully being displayed on screen. </p>
<p>Right-click the Desktop background and choose <strong>Display Settings</strong> 
and under <strong>Scale &amp; Layout</strong> change <strong>Scale</strong> from 125% to 100%</p>
<h1 id="fix-sleep-mode-disabling-hibernation">Fix Sleep Mode - Disabling Hibernation</h1>
<p>Hibernation is unnecessary and can result in BSODs. Additionally it consumes space. Run Command Prompt as Administrator and enter the following:</p>

<code>Powercfg /h /type reduced</code></p>
<h1 id="reduce-fan-noise">Reduce Fan Noise</h1>
<p>You can reduce fan noise by setting the idle minimum to 0% - Run Command Prompt as Administrator and enter the following:</p>

<h1 id="disabling-windows-upgrades-feature-updates">Disabling Windows Upgrades/Feature Updates</h1>
<p>Windows has in the past had a history of breaking Valve&#39;s drivers(ex. Audio Drivers broken in 22H2). Valve usually provides an updated driver, but it is not an immediate thing. To be safe, it is likely best to use InControl to disable feature updates using InControl. </p>
<p>Download the software:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.grc.com/incontrol.htm">GRC Software - InControl</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Run it and click the button to block updates. No further action is necessary. </p>

<li>This will not stop Windows Security Updates from installing(if wanted, use O&amp;O Shutup for that, discussed below)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="disabling-windows-telemetry-and-all-windows-updates-optional-">Disabling Windows Telemetry(and all Windows Updates -- OPTIONAL)</h1>
<p>As previously mentioned, if you would like to disable updates entirely, or just block Windows Telemetry, or both, you can use O&amp;O Shutup to do so. Note that disabling Windows updates entirely, does increase the security risk on your Steamdeck.</p>
<p>Download, install and run O&amp;O Shutup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10">O&amp;O Shutup 10++</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Search in the top-right for Telemetry and toggle all to be blocked</p>

<li>Repeate this for automatic updates if you would like</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="remove-disable-windows-defender-completely-optional-">Remove/Disable Windows Defender Completely(OPTIONAL)</h1>
<p>Major security risk -- so entirely optional. For this I won&#39;t provide &quot;easy&quot; instructions because it&#39;s not recommended for the average user, but the instructions below will do this(disabling Real-Time protection stuff in normal Windows, won&#39;t completely disable it):</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot into Safe Mode and open Registry Editor</li>
<li>Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Change the following folders key &quot;Start&quot; DWORD to value &quot;4&quot;</p>

<li>Sense</li>
<li>WdBoot</li>
<li>WdFilter</li>
<li>WdNisDrv</li>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<h3 id="what-is-this-application-"><em>What is this Application ?</em></h3>
<p>Steam Deck Tools - SteamController app is a fully functional controller application that works on both Steam and non-steam games.
Non-Steam games are treated as a Xbox360 Controller unless you run it through Steam Input(more on this configuration later)</p>
<p>This application is being constantly updated on a frequent basis. While this guide will try to provide as up-to-date of details as possible, it is recommended that you review the latest release notes and front-page for setup and configuration located here -- <a href="https://steam-deck-tools.ayufan.dev/">https://steam-deck-tools.ayufan.dev/</a></p>

<h3 id="i-have-swicd-should-i-replace-it-"><em>I have SWICD, should I replace it?</em></h3>
<p>This is totally up to your preference. I personally say yes, it is worth replacing. SteamController can work together with Steam Input, with one menu click and is continuing to have more improvements/features and bug fixes. It also relies on less third-party applications to function.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Use X360 Controller with Steam (this means all Steam Games will function like a X360 Controller)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Steam Input with Steam (this means when playing a native Steam Game((not a non-steam game inside Steam)), it will see your controller as a Steam Deck controller)</p>

<h1 id="dxvk-vulkan-direct3d-rendering-on-windows-">DXVK (Vulkan Direct3D Rendering on Windows)</h1>
<p>Some games may function better in SteamOS thanks to Vulkan Shader-caching. However, Windows has the same capabilities. A couple things to note however is that it is not recommended for online games with anti-cheat as it could result in a ban due to the modification/addition to game files -- and it does not work for Gamepass games in testing.</p>
<p>You can set this up by following the YouTube guide here (highly recommend DXVK A-Sync):</p>

<p>This is because <strong>Lizard Mode</strong> is enabled in SWICD. Generally, if you&#39;re playing a controller game, this should be turned off.

As a workaround, when you are using the desktop you can turn off <strong>Controller Emulation</strong> in SWICD. If you are using the configuration provided in 1.4 Controller Configuration, you can toggle this on/off by pressing <strong>Steam</strong> + <strong>R5</strong></p>

<h2 id="force-5ghz-mode-on-steamdeck">Force 5Ghz Mode on SteamDeck</h2>
<p>For Wireless Access Points that don&#39;t have a separate SSID for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, you can force the SteamDeck to connect to 5Ghz by changing the Wireless Mode in the Driver Configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Control panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Network Adapters &gt; Double-Click the RealTek 8822CE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E-NIC</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and change <strong>Wireless Mode</strong> from Auto to 802.11a/n/ac(depending on which driver is installed, it may not have this option)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-a-separate-5ghz-ssid-for-steamdeck">Create a separate 5GHZ SSID for SteamDeck</h2>
<p>Some users have reported creating a new SSID and only joining the SteamDeck to it resolved their issues, even on the same wireless access point. Also, it is recommended that if you have a wireless network that broadcasts both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, to create a 5Ghz only SSID and join the SteamDeck to this</p>
<h2 id="try-another-wireless-access-point-or-hotspot-">Try another Wireless Access Point(or Hotspot)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, SteamDeck appears to be extremely picky about the wireless device it&#39;s connected to. If you can try a spare wireless access point, or a hotspot from your phone, this will help determine if the issue is related to your wireless network specifically.</p>

<h2 id="my-games-are-slower-since-apu-upgrade-or-i-get-errors-when-launching-games-that-used-to-work-before-upgrade">My games are slower since APU Upgrade or I get errors when launching games that used to work before upgrade</h2>
<p>Unfortunately if you did not choose &quot;Factory Reset&quot; when installing the latest APU drivers, then it is likely that the APU driver is the cause of your performance issues. To fix this, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and run the <a href="https://pixeldrain.com/u/PJCxJh2c">old APU Drivers from June 2016 Here</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>When running the installer, click the <strong>Additional Options</strong> on the right and then choose <strong>Factory Reset</strong> on the left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After this has finished installing/rebooted your Steam Deck, download the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8">current APU Driver from here</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform the same steps as in Step 2, with the new driver.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the Steam Deck reboots, everything should be good. If you have unlocked the Refresh Rates as outlined in Section 1.5, you will need to use Custom Resolution Utility again and re-import the BIN file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="online-games-have-stutter-long-load-times-fortnite-destiny-2-">Online Games have stutter/long load times (Fortnite, Destiny 2)</h2>
<p>These stutters are often related to poor wireless performance. Please follow instructions to download and set up unlocked wireless drivers. If you still have issues, please follow the instructions in the same guide about changing custom settings:</p>
