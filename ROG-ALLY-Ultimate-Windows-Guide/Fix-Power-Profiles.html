          <p class="page" id="WIP"></p><h2>Power Profiles are Broken?</h2>
          <p>Well, not exactly. They work OK, but the issue many have found is that the power profiles on battery, do not perform the same as when plugged in</p>
          <p>Additionally, there are some questionable settings, especially if you were coming from a Steam Deck, such as CPU Boost being turned on for all profiles</p>
          <p>or things like Power Profiles having TDP boosts that go up to 10W TDP more, then drop back down after a few minutes</p>
          <h2>What's the Fix?</h2>
          <p>I have developed an application called BSL-Tools-RAE (ROG ALLY Edition) that will let you customize power profiles and configure hotkeys to quickly switch between different settings</p>
          <h3><strong>DISCLAIMER: The application could trigger a BAN for Anti-Cheat games - If you want to play these kind of games and use this software, here are some guidelines:</strong></h3>
          <li>Do not adjust settings while inside the game(TDP, CPU Boost, Power Matching)</li>
          <li>Do not enable Auto-Switcher features in the application</li>
          <p><strong>The link to download the application is right here on a separate Github Repo:</strong></p>

          <p>I don't want to single everyone out to using "My Tool" for changes, there are other apps you will find in the <a href="https://baldsealion.github.io/PC-Handheld-Guides/ROG-ALLY-Ultimate-Windows-Guide/Additional-Applications.html">Additional Applications</a> section</p>
          <p>The issue I have found with most of these other applications though, is they are not meant to co-exist alongside Armoury Crate SE, whereas mine was built with this purpose in mind</p>
          <p>The majority(possibly all) of these applications also use similar methods to control power, which can result in a ban in Anti-Cheat games as well, you have been warned</p>
          <p>I didn't plan to make a program, I just got to this section of the guide and it became the only option that made sense</p>
